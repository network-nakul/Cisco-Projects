# CCNA Projects

This repository showcases my networking projects created during my CCNA studies. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate practical implementations of various CCNA concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer. These projects reflect my understanding of core networking concepts and configurations.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Apply theoretical knowledge from the CCNA curriculum in practical networking scenarios.
- Simulate real-world network setups using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Demonstrate my skills in configuring, managing, and troubleshooting network infrastructures.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Basic Network Setup**
   - **Subnetting**: Dividing a network into subnets and assigning IPs.
   - **Static Routing**: Manually configuring routes between networks.

### 2. **Dynamic Routing Protocols**
   - **RIP**: Configuring Routing Information Protocol for automatic routing.
   - **OSPF**: Implementing Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) for dynamic routing.

### 3. **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**
   - **VLAN Configuration**: Segregating network traffic into VLANs.
   - **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Enabling communication between different VLANs.

### 4. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - Setting up DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses to network devices.

### 5. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
   - Configuring ACLs to control network traffic and enhance security.

### 6. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**
   - Implementing NAT to allow internal devices to communicate with external networks.

### 7. **Switching and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**
   - Setting up switches and configuring STP to prevent network loops.

### 8. **IPv6 Configuration**
   - Setting up IPv6 addresses and ensuring network connectivity.
